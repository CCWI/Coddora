<h2>Coddora: CO2-Based Occupancy Detection Model Trained via Domain Randomization</h2>

This repository provides source code and trained models of the paper
<i>"Coddora: CO2-Based Occupancy Detection Model Trained via Domain Randomization"</i> to be presented at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN).<br><br>
<i>Coddora</i> is a simulation-trained deep learning model for detecting occupancy from CO2 rates in building rooms.<br> 
It is intended to support rapid application in practice, without the need for extensive collection of training data in real-world buildings.  
<br><br>
The simulated dataset used for model training can be found here:
